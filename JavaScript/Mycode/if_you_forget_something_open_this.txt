This files has some stupid or maybe important instruction,
for when I forget something and I will keep adding more
instruction if I require it.

Always open your .html file with live server
to use the console there.

Open the link.txt to open playlist from which I studied,
it also has other important links too

AND IF YOU FORGET TO CHANGE LINE 55 OF index.html,
if you have made a new .js file for some coding 
you will not see any changes on the console you fucking dumbass nigga
