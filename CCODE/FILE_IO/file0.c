line 13 explanation for "it still works if we use return 0 then what is the reason to use 1 and not 0 explain"

In C, the main() function typically returns an integer value to indicate the
status of the program execution to the operating system. Conventionally,
a return value of 0 from main() indicates successful execution, while a non-zero
value typically indicates some kind of error or abnormal termination.

In the modified code snippet I provided, if the file cannot be opened successfully,
it prints an error message and then returns 1. This indicates to the operating system
that the program encountered an error during execution.

Here's why 1 is used instead of 0:

Using 0 to indicate an error would imply that the program exited successfully, which is misleading.

By using 1, it adheres to the convention that non-zero values are returned to indicate an error or abnormal termination.

So, when the program encounters an error such as failing to open the file, it returns 1, signaling to the operating system
that there was a problem during execution. This can be useful for scripting or batch processing scenarios where the calling
environment might want to take action based on the success or failure of the program.
